# First tutorial example

An algorithm that computes particle-level jets


# Structure of this example

* `run_hls.tcl`: configuration & startup file for Vivado HLS defining the project, the input files, etc
* `src` directory with the header file and implementation for the synthesis (i.e. to to be compiled into firmware)
   * `data.h`: define the dataformats
   * `algo.h`, `algo.cpp`: header and source file for the code to be synthethised
* `algo_ref.cpp`: a clean and readable reference implementation of the algorithm, for validation
* `algo_test.cpp`: C++ testbench, that runs the algorithm. 
* `pfcands_ttbar.txt`: an input file of Puppi candidates and ak4 Puppi jets dumped from CMSSW, used as input for the test bench


# Running the example
## Batch mode using Tcl script
`vivado_hls -f run_hls.tcl`

# Some different levels of optimization in the implementation

Multiple versions of algo.cpp are committed in the source code 
* `algo_v0.cpp`: First attempt, with loop-based `find_seed` function to find the seed: At II=2, Latency 162. Resources: 0 BRAMs, 540 DSPs, 119k FFs, 99k LUTs.

* `algo_v1.cpp`: with recursive-template `find_seed` to reduce the latency but with some increase in resources: At II=2, Latency 90, Resources: 0 BRAMs, 540 DSPs, 89k FFs, 140k LUTs.
* `algo_v4.cpp`: optimization of the implementation: code cleanup, set bit precisions, implement the division with a lookup table (reduce further the latency)
    * At II=2, Latency 52, Resources: 3 BRAMs, 546 DSPs, 90k FFs, 131k LUTs
    * At II=1, Latency 52, Resources: 6 BRAMs, 552 DSPs, 119k FFs, 209k LUTs 
* `algo.cpp` (best version):
   * Optimized seeding using partial sorting to bring the seed as first element in the list, to reduce the candidates to be evaluated at each step. At II=1, Latency 39, Resources: 6 BRAMs, 489 DSPs, 102k FFs, 78k LUTs
